# My First Ultra
On February 18th, 2023, I was supposed to run my first ultra marathon. It was a 55K in Moab, Utah. A tough route mostly comprised of singletrack and slick rock that boasted an elevation gain and loss of 4,000+. Sadly, due to snow, the event was cancelled.

When I got the news, I was bummed. I was excited to travel back out to Salt Lake City (where I lived before moving to NYC) and Moab, and I was looking forward to doing a technical trail race (this would have been my first). Despite the disappointment, I decided I would not let my training go to waste. Rather, I mapped out a 55k route around New York City and ran it on the same day the race was supposed to be.

This run was full of learnings, ranging from my body, the "pain cave", and my mind.

# Learnings and What's Next?
## Learnings
### My Mind
One of the most fascinating takeaways from this run was that there was never a second throughout it where I felt I could no longer continue. There were times where I felt bored or annoyed with the route (mostly due to closures along the East Side Highway and the busy-ness of the streets), but I never questioned whether I would or could continue. I realized that my mind is strong, and that is something I should always use to my advantage going forward.

I learned that the greatest difficulties are the ones that pop-up when things don't go according to plan. It is easy to have a calloused mind when things are going as you expected, but the minute things go off track doubts start to creep in. Mastering these doubts is key.
### My Body
Running a city ultra is arguably tougher than running a trail ultra. The constant pounding of the pavement hurts. It puts a lot of stress on your legs, and the stop-and-go nature of running around the inner streets of NYC did not make it much easier. I look forward to when I have a trail ultra that I can compare this to. At this point in time, all I can say is that the slight give that loose rock and dirt provide is a welcome feeling in comparison to the harsh contact of constant foot-to-concrete. A little bit of mountainous scenery would have also helped.

One thing I was really happy about with this run: the pain was felt equally throughout my legs. Both quads were similarly sore, both knees felt soreness in the same ways, and both ankles and toes are recovering similarly. I have yet to feel pangs of pain differently in different areas. Left leg and right leg, left knee and right knee, and even left big toe and right big toe all are experiencing similar things right now.

I have a hypothesis that feeling pain equally and evenly distributed throughout whatever part of your body you are working on (legs, in this example. Maybe arms or chest in different scenarios) is something to strive for. It means equal distribution of effort, and it means symmetricity. I strive for symmetricity in training.
### The "Pain Cave"
The pain cave is a place well-known to endurance athletes. I first heard about it from [Courtney Dauwalter](https://www.theringer.com/sports/2022/8/30/23323367/courtney-dauwalter-ultra-running-marathon). I spent some time here furing my first Ultra. 

The biggest disappointment from this run was my inability to maintain pace. I guess this is a challenge every runner faces. I am confident I could have maintained a 9ish mile pace consistently for the *entire* race, but instead I slowly faltered off to 9:30+ minute miles. I keep asking myself why this was? Right now, my best guess is lack of comfortability with hurting. The mix of not knowing my body well enough and not having run enough marathon+ events means I did not know how much I could push myself. I could now answer the question: "How much can you really take?"

When I started to hurt, I took it easier. I did not push through, and I did not obsess over my pace. When a gust of wind hit me head-on, I openly accepted it instead of putting my head down and plowing through. Was the goal here was to finish, or to stretch my upper limits? 

At the end of the run, I realized that the pain I experienced would have likely been similar regardless of the pace I maintained. Running 30 seconds faster on average across every mile would not have hurt me much more. My body could have taken that. But the question now is how do I work towards knowing that cadence and the SPM (strides per minute) needed to maintain that pace? I do not want to obsess over monitoring my watch, so I need to go back to the drawing board and learn more about my body and my breathing. Heart rate monitoring helps, too.

## What's Next?
Well given that the 55k in Moab was cancelled, I have a free [ultra running event voucher](https://ultrasignup.com/default.aspx) for this year. A 50 miler sounds nice.
