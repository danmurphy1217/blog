# About
This blog is about a whole lot. It's not just about training, or running, or the things that I learn at work. It's about life in general. Running, training, and work are big parts of it, but it also extends far beyond just that. 

I learn from everything that I do - whether it is a success, failure, or something in between. Therefore, I must write about a whole lot, too. I strive to become a better engineer, better leader, better runner or triathlete, and more in every single challenge I take on. I am constantly pushing, constantly evaluating, and always reflecting. This blog is my attempt to provide succint analysis so that I can monitor my growth over time and help others who find themself in a similar situation.
